At this time of lockin, why not treat yourself to good knowledge.

1. Stay away from social media as it does nothing for you. Stay away from news, videos, audios spreading through Whatsapp Groups. Stay away from Facebook and Youtube as they are all greedy platforms trying to make advertising money off your distress.
2. Stay away from news channels as they are paid to keep you glued to the screen and they do that through creating outrage in you.
3. Get your news from government press releases. Follow your district collectors page. You can also look at [US CDC](https://cdc.gov), [The WHO](https://who.int) for facts and relevant information.

There are some online resources for free which are of great value:
