When there is a pandemic, especially a viral one, there is nothing much you can do. You can stay indoors, prevent contact and boost your immunity. Your immunity is the only thing that can help at this point. So anything that boosts immunity or helps fight against viruses can be considered.

This by no means is an exhaustive list and I am only sharing the information we have gathered.

## Do not consume without consulting a doctor

The below document only points some research and in by no means is a recommendation of drugs. You will have to speak to a doctor with your case history before having any drugs or vitamins or supplements mentioned below.

### Vitamin C

Vitamin C is a no brainer. Vitamin C is a strong antioxidant and has great immunity boosting properties. A dosage of 500 mg / day for an adult should be an easy choice.

* Cost: Rs 15 / 15 tablets

### Vitamin D3

Low Vitamin D3 levels promote viral epidemics. This is why traditionally the flu season happens in low sun seasons. Today with exposure to sun significantly low because of modern lifestyles, most people are deficient in this absolutely key vitamin .Vitamin D can reduce the risk of viral epidemics and pandemics in several ways. First, higher 25(OH)D concentrations (Vitamin D sufficiency) reduce the risk of many chronic diseases, including cancers, cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory tract infections (RTIs), diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. Patients with chronic diseases have significantly higher risk of death from RTIs than otherwise healthy people. Second, vitamin D reduces risk of RTIs through three mechanisms: maintaining tight junctions, killing enveloped viruses through induction of cathelicidin and defensins, and reducing production of proinflammatory cytokines by the innate immune system, thereby reducing the risk of a cytokine storm leading to pneumonia. Observational and supplementation trials have reported higher 25(OH)D concentrations associated with reduced risk of dengue, hepatitis, herpesvirus, hepatitis B and C viruses, human immunodeficiency virus, influenza, respiratory syncytial virus infections, and pneumonia.

* Dosage recommended in studies: 1200 IU / day (Do not consume more than 4000 IU per day as it will cause Vitamin D toxicity in the long run.
* Cost: Rs 4 / tablet of 600 IU

### Iodine

Iodine inactivates viruses. There are hardly any known virus in the past years which are not killed by Iodine. The salivary glands, nasal mucosa, and lungs all secrete mucus which contains iodine. But this happens only after the thyroid glad has had its fill of Iodine. Unfortunately [most of us are iodine difficient](http://iodocefol.com/brochure/iodocefol.html#sec-3-2-2) and the thyroid gland will use up all available iodine. If the daily iodine dose is above 3 mg for over 2 weeks, the thyroid gland becomes saturated and no longer takes up much iodine. Then, dietary iodine goes to other sites named above and is excreted into the upper respiratory and gastrointestinal tract mucus. It seems logical that air borne viruses become stuck in mucus and killed by free iodine.

However, having 3 mg of Iodine will not be advised by doctors as our current RDA guidelines are at 150 micrograms of Iodine per day.

### Ayurveda

If you have access to professional Ayurveda doctors, you could inquire on immunity boosting medicines in Ayurveda. There are quite a few of them. I recently learned that the Dasamoola Jeerakaarishtam is one of them. But please get your suggestions from doctors.
