# Povidone Iodine
Povidone-iodine (PVP-I), also known as iodopovidone, is an antiseptic used for skin disinfection. In a study conducted in Japan [^1] PVP-I was fouond to be effective in inactivating a range of viruses including adeno-, mumps, rota-, polio- (types 1 and 3), coxsackie-, rhino-, herpes simplex, rubella, measles, influenza and human immunodeficiency viruses. PVP-I is found to be very effective and viruses doesnt seem to have developed any form of resistence to this antiseptic.

## What can we do with Iodine

Aerosol iodine was found to kill viruses in sprayed mists, and solutions ofiodine were equally effective. In 1945, Burnet and Stone found that putting iodine on mice snouts pre-vented the mice from being infected with live influenza virus in mists. They suggested that impregnatingmasks  with  iodine  would  help  stop  viral  spread. They  also  recommended  that  medical  personnel  haveiodine-aerosol-treated rooms for examination and treatment of highly infected patients. Current methodsof dealing with influenza infection are isolation, hand washing, antiviral drugs, and vaccinations. All ofthese methods can be improved by incorporating iodine into them. When impregnated with iodine, masksbecome much more effective, and hand washing is more effect when done with mild iodine solutions.Isolation techniques coupled with aerosol iodine would make them safer for patients, medical personnel,and all persons working with the public. Public health authorities could organize the distribution of iodineand at the same time educate the public in the effective use of iodine. Oral iodine might also boost bodydefense mechanisms in the upper oral and respiratory mucus. [^2]

## How can we use PVP-I

Go to your pharmacy and purchase Betadine solutions or Povidone Iodine Solution. Depending on the brand you get the price will vary hugely. For e.g Betadine is 10% solution with 1% free Iodine and costs Rs 102. If you go to Jan Oushadhi you get a 5% solution with 0.5% Free Iodine for Rs 19! Get any.

You can use the solution the following ways:

1. Aerosol - Dilute the Iodine solution from 10% to 0.5% by adding 20 times water (or 5% to 0.5% by adding 10 times water) to the solution and put it in a glass cleaner solution bottle or a regular spray bottle. Turn on the fan and spray into it, keeping your eyes closed, the liquid will disperse nicely into the air and will inactivate any virus in the air.
2. Disinfectant - Use the same dilution as above and wipe floors and surfaces using this liquid.
3. Masks - Take three pieces of cloth 10cm by 15cm. Dip one piece of cloth in the liquid of (2) above and dry it. Use this piece as a middle layer, stick the the three together and attach elastic to go around your ear. You have your own anticeptic mask.
4. Gargle - Dilute to the same 20 times level as above and gargle without swallowing. To be fair research has actually shown that just gargling with water has better effect than even PVP. So I'd recommend gargling on a regular basis. This is shown to prevent getting upper respiratory diseases. COVID19 is one of them.
